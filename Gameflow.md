# GAMEFLOW

This is the target gameplay of the modpack. All changes and additions to the modpack should abide by this.

## STAGES
### SCAVENGER STAGE (0-40 min)
The early stage begins with picking up stones added by the nopunchingtrees mod. Sticks are obtained from leaf blocks scattered around the city. Crafting tables are found inside buildings, along with furnaces. Basic materials such as logs, food, stone, and iron are obtained and used. Glass shards from Quark are crafted into bottles. The players should have at least tools and a weapon to fend off mobs. They are unable to take over haunted buildings though.

### LOOTING STAGE (40-180 min)
Players have at least stone tools and an iron sword. Some armor is collected from the Lost Souls mod.
