# GAMEFLOW

This is the target gameplay of the modpack. All changes and additions to the modpack should abide by this.

## STAGES
### SCAVENGER STAGE (0-40 min)
The early stage begins with picking up stones added by the nopunchingtrees mod. Sticks are obtained from leaf blocks scattered around the city. Crafting tables are found inside buildings, along with furnaces. Basic materials such as logs, food, stone, and iron are obtained and used. Glass shards from Quark are crafted into bottles. The players should have at least tools and a weapon to fend off mobs. They are unable to take over haunted buildings though. Players attempt to build a tree farm.  

### LOOTING STAGE (40-240 min)
Players have at least stone tools and an iron sword. Some armor is collected from the Lost Souls mod. Players already have some cooked food and a shelter with aquedate heating systems. Players have a constant source of logs. They start to develop a farm of some sort.  Players have a small ammount of basic tech ingredients that they have yet to fully process. They are able to take over haunted buildings with effort and teamwork. Some decent amount of mining is done.

### FIRST TECH STAGE (240-540 min)
Players have amassed some starting tech, and have set up some simple machines. Players are capable of producing limited RF/EU and using it to their advantage. Players have good armor, and can easily loot buildings from Lost Souls. Trade with Custom NPCs is done, some wealth is gained from trade. The players are focused on getting upgrades for their machines, looted from chests or traded with Custom NPCs. Players have machinery capable of processing advanced ores and liquids. Players mine for more advanced ores.

### SECOND TECH STAGE (540-1080 min)
Players have amassed a good amount of starting tech, and have a limited amount of second stage tech. They are capable of producing RF/EU that allows them to process resources. Players still have to trade and loot to progress to the next stage of technology, as they lack any way to produce better machines. Automatic production is done through the use of pipes and others. Clean water and heating is not a problem anymore. Players have either an automatic or semi-automatic food farm.

### THIRD TECH STAGE (1080-2080 min)
Players have amassed a good amount of second stage tech, and have a limited amount of third stage tech. They are capable of producing RF/EU and items without having to constantly monitor the system - it automatically manages itself. Players have good armor, around full diamond protection. Most of their weapons can easily dispatch Lost Souls buildings. Alot of advanced ore is mined, and some items necessary for whatever final gamestage are obtained. Third stage tech is collected from Lost Souls and trades. 

### FOURTH TECH STAGE (2080-4000 min)
Players have amassed a good amount of third stage tech, and have a limited amount of fourth stage tech. They are capable of producing tonnes of RF/EU, and have automatic production lines for their needs. Some progress is made towards the end game event. Player armor and weapons is much stronger than diamond. Combat with advanced Custom NPCs is effortless. Fourth Stage tech is either traded, looted, or created out of mined material. Storage solutions are setup at this point.

### FINAL TECH STAGE (4000-5000 min)
Players have all fourth stage tech, and can use UU matter to mass produce items that are needed. Factories and generators produce extremely efficiently, and can run fully independent of players. Player storage is efficient and can also run without player intervention. Players are directly preparing for the end game event.

### END GAME EVENT (5000-5060 min)
Players collect all resources needed to start the endgame event, and do it.
